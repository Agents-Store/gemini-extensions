# image-search-dev (Gemini CLI extension)

Stock image and video search developer toolkit. MCP tool patterns for Pexels (9 tools) and Unsplash (4 tools) from mcpware-dev-tools. Photo search, video search, collections, curated content, and MinIO upload integration.

## Status

Consumer access to the Gemini CLI closed on 2026-06-18; this extension is maintained for **enterprise Gemini Code Assist**, which still runs the Gemini CLI extension format (the consumer-facing successor is Antigravity CLI).

## Install

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/Agents-Store/gemini-extensions
```

The [geminicli.com](https://geminicli.com) gallery — and the `install <url>` form above — only resolve a repository that carries `gemini-extension.json` at its **root**. This extension ships from the `agents-store-gemini-extensions` monorepo, where every plugin lives in its own subdirectory, so it will not appear in the gallery and the command above will not resolve directly. Until that repository is split one-plugin-per-repo, install locally instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agents-Store/gemini-extensions
gemini extensions link gemini-extensions/image-search-dev
```
