"""PreToolUse guard for Plane MCP tools (stdlib only).

Reads the hook input JSON from stdin (``tool_name``, ``tool_input``) and answers with
Claude Code's PreToolUse decision format:

* destructive action  -> ``permissionDecision: "ask"``: Claude Code shows its normal
  permission dialog with the reason; the user's "yes" lets the call through. Besides the
  actions the server marks destructive, ``manage_workitems`` with a non-empty ``remove_ids``
  (``unlink_ids`` on ``customer``) counts: it takes work items out of a cycle, module,
  milestone, initiative, release or customer, which the per-operation ``remove_*`` tools did
  and which the dialog must keep covering.
* archive action      -> ``additionalContext`` only (a warning for Claude, no dialog).
* anything else, a tool of a server that is not Plane, or malformed input -> no output.

The guard fails open: it never exits non-zero and never prints on bad input.
Plane MCP 0.3+ exposes resource tools (``mcp__<server>__cycle`` with ``action``); older
per-operation connectors put the operation in the tool name (``mcp__<server>__delete_cycle``).
